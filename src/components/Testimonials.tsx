    review: "Had the pleasure of working with Jaffar today at Domain.com and I couldn't have had a better experience. I've talked to a few support people from Domain.com and they said they couldn't help me but Jaffar did and he fixed it all simply. His knowledge and how fast he was - I really appreciate the assistance. 5 stars",

    review: "Got some help from Jaffar, great help. He listened, he understood the issue, didn't just reply with standard copy/paste replies and he sorted the issue all while being nice and friendly at the same time. Take a lesson from this customer service rep!",
